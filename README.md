# Introduction

SharpMeter is a library to communicate with meter using PSEM or COSM.


  

# Getting Started

- Direct usage by using SharpMeter.dll and adding it as reference in VS
 *- [WIP] Exposed COM functionality*
- Load the entire solution and use "Test Meter" project


  

# Build and Test

Open solution via VS and build it

  

# Status

**- PSEM [C12]:**
